## mycode folder
Contains functions which are separated based on which user/functionality they apply to.
Some files contain more than one function.

## tests folder
Each file has a passing and failing test for each function in mycode.
The failing tests have "assert <test> == False" so when you run pytest all of the tests will pass.
