I was confused when I tried to run the sql code for the second schema and it said it had to skip all of the tables since they didn't exist. I was worried that none of the tables got set up correctly, but when I refreshed the schema, all of the tables where listed as normal, so that was misleading.

It was also confusing to have to select the augur database specifically before running the code provided to us, and I accidently set up the augur tables schema in the postgres database.

Everything else went pretty smoothly. As far as I can tell I have all 3 schemas and their tables set up correctly.

I would have appreciated more guidance with the of-out-class installing process, which we had to cover at the beginning of class.
