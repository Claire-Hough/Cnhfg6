# Ideas
	(1,2) - The web UI should have a similiar look and feel to git hub
	(3,3) - Developers should be able to attach applications to the API and customize their organization structure.
	(2,2) - There should be a forum for developers to discuss issues and community interest
	(2,4) - There should be templates/example structures available to referrence for new projects
	(2,1) - Track turn around times for fixing issues
	(3,2) - Monitor how many issues appear after new releases (check quality of code)
	(2,2) - Track quantity of documentation posted for projects
	(4,2) - Track quality of documentation
	(2,1) - There should be a log of progress, documents problems that arise throughout the development process
	(1,2) - Can tag projects with relevant topics (AI, web dev...)
	(4,4) - Measure how many times each person commits, how they're involved, some sort of "upvoting" on commits by other developers
	(5,3) - Commits can be weighted to give developers a "score"; small bug fixes are worth less than large additions
	(2,2) - Comparison tool from different points in dev process (can see how much original code still exists)
	(1,1) - Will require a server to host a web app
	(2,3) - Have popular libraries readily available
	(2,1) - Be capable of downloading images and project metrics
	(4,1) - Timeline of people working on project, visually graphs involvement of each contributor, their commits, and the weight of their contributions
	(2,4) - Contributions will be categorized, a css file with 100 lines isn't the same as a c file with 100 lines
	(1,1)- Each issues/requirements have a ranking system for importance/time sensitivity
	(1,1) - There should be a way to indicate who is working on what requirement
	(3,3) - Should be able to assign "due dates" to issues, rewarded for finishing before/on due date
	(2,4) - Track active contributors vs inactive ones
	(3,3) - Labeling system for repos to search for similar projects
